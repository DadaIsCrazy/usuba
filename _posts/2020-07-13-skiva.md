Fault attacks [1,2,3,4] consist in tampering with a device in order to
induce faults in its computations. The most common ways to do so
consist in under-powering [14] or over-powering [5,11], blasting
ionizing light (_eg._ lasers) [8,9,12], inducing clock glitches
[6,10], or using electromagnetic (EM) impulsions [12,13], even though
less common techniques exist, like heating up or cooling down [7], or
using X-rays or ion beams [2].


<!--
Fault attacks:

 - algorithm modification: 
   + Fault on the data. Example on Eliptic curve cryptography [27]
   + Fault on the control flow: skipping an instruction [28], replacing instructions [10].
 
 - differential fault analysis (DFA) [15] uses correct and faulty
   ciphertexts from the same plaintexts and applies differential
   cryptanalysis techniques to recover the key.
 
 - Safe Error Attack (SEA) [23] observes wether a fault as an impact
   on the output, and deduce values of some variables.
 
 - statistical fault analysis (SFA) [24] don't require to know
   plaintext: inject fault at chosen location, and decrypt the
   ciphertext back to where the fault was injected.

 - Innefective Fault Attacks (IFA) [25] quite like SEA: observes if
   modifying (_eg._ stuck-at-zero) an intermediate value affects the
   result: if no, then the original value was 0 as well.
 
 - SIFA (based IFA and SFA) [26] similar to SFA but uses only
   ineffective faults to deduce a bias in the distribution of the
   plaintext.
--> 

There are several ways to exploit faults. Algorithm-specific attacks
aim at changing the behavior of a cipher at the algorithmic level by
modifying either some of its data [27] or alter its control flow by
skipping [28] or replacing [10] some of its instructions. Differential
fault analysis (DFA) [15] uses differential cryptanalysis techniques
to recover the secret key by comparing correct and faulty ciphertexts
produced from the same plaintexts. Safe-error attacks (SEA) [23]
simply observes wether a fault has an impact on the output of the
cipher, and thus deduce the values of some secret
variables. Statistical fault analysis (SFA) [24], unlike SEA and DFA
does not require correct ciphertexts: by injecting a fault at a chosen
location and partially decrypting the ciphertext up to that location,
SFA can be used to recover secret bits. Innefective fault attacks
(IFA) [25] are similar to SEA: the basic idea is to set an
intermediate variable at 0 (using a so-called _stuck-at-zero_ fault),
and if the ciphertext is unaffected by this fault (the fault is
_ineffective_), then the original value of this intermediate variable
was already 0, thus revealing secret information. Finally, based on
SFA and IFA, SIFA [26] uses ineffective faults to deduce a bias in the
distribution of some secret data.


Various countermeasures can be designed to prevent fault
attacks. Hardware protections can be designed to either prevent or
detect faults, using for instance active or passive shields [30],
integrity checks [42] or other tampering detection mechanisms
[43,44,45]. However, those techniques tend to be expensive and lack
genericity: each countermeasures protects against a known set of
attacks and the hardware might be vulnerable to new attacks
[2]. Software countermeasures on the other hand are less expansive and
easier to adapt to new fault attacks. Software countermeasures can be
either part of the design of the cryptographic algorithm -in the
protocol [31] or the primitive [18]-, or added to the implementation
of existing ciphers by using redundant operations, error detection
codes or consistency checks [32,33,34,35].


One must be careful when implementing countermeasures against fault
attack, since they can increase the vulnerability to other
side-channel analysis [46,19,20]. For instance, [36] shows that using
direct redundant bytes leaks more information than using complementary
redundant bytes.


Only few work deal with protection against both side-channel analysis
and fault injection. Schneider _et al._ [17] proposed an approach
combining threshold implementation (TI) [21] -to defend against SCA-
and concurrent error detection [22] -to thwart fault attacks-.


Combined countermeasures:

 - [47,48,49] redundancy on top of SCA resistance
 
 - ParTI [17]. Hardware. Based on Threshold implementation [21] for
   SCA resistance, and error detecting codes [22].

 - CAPA [16] detects more faults than [17]. Provable security against
   combined attacks. Hardware, but adapatable to software under some
   constraints on the architecture. Based on secure multi-party
   computation protocols (MPC). Costly.

 - ... [18] by design in the cipher.


## SKIVA

SKIVA is a custom 32-bit processor that enables a modular approach to
countermeasure design, giving programmers the flexibility to protect
their ciphers against timing-based side-channel analysis, power-based
side-channel analysis and/or fault injection at various levels of
security. Modularity is achieved through bitslicing, each
countermeasure being expressed as a transformation from a bitsliced
design into another bitsliced design. The capabilities of SKIVA are
demonstrated on the Advanced Encryption Standard, but the proposed
techniques can be applied to other ciphers as well.

SKIVA was designed by Pantea Kiaei (Virginia Tech) and Patrick
Schaumont (Worcester Polytechnic Institue). We added a backend to
Usubac to generate code for SKIVA, thus freing the developpers from
the burden of writing low-level assembly code to target SKIVA. We also
condutected a performance evaluation of AES on SKIVA, and evaluated
experimentally its tolerance to faults.

We start by presenting how which countermeasures SKIVA offers, and how
they are combined. Then, we present the hardware support SKIVA
provides to improve both the security and speed of those
countermeasures. Finally, we evaluate the performances of an
Usubac-generated AES implementation on SKIVA at various security
level.


## Modular countermeasures

SKIVA features four protection mechanisms that can be combined in a
modular manner: bitslicing to protect against timing attacks,
higher-orger masking to protect against power side-channel leakage,
intra-instruction redundancy to protect against data faults and
temporal redundancy to protect against control faults. We use AES as
an example, but the techniques are equally applicable to other
bitsliceable ciphers.

SKIVA requires ciphers to be fully bitsliced. For instance, the
128-bit input of AES is represented with 128 variables. Since each
variable stores 32 bits on SKIVA, 32 instances of AES can be computed
in a single run of the primitive. The key to compose countermeasures
in SKIVA is to use some of those 32 instances to store redundant bits
(to protect against fault attacks), or masked shares (to protect
against power analysis). The following figure shows the organisation
of the slices for masked and intra-instruction-redundant design:

<p align="center" style="margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px;">
<img style="height:auto;width:auto;max-width:100%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog/skiva-layouts/layout.png">
</p>

SKIVA supports masking with 1, 2, and 4 shares leading to respectively
unmasked, 1st-order, and 3rd-order masked implementations. By
convention, the letter _D_ is used to denote the number of shares (_D_
∈ {1,2,4}) of a given implementation. Within a machine word, the _D_
shares encoding the i<sup>th</sup> bit are grouped together, as
illustrated by the contiguously colored bits
b<sub>i</sub><sup>j∈[1,<i>D</i>]</sup> in the figure above.

SKIVA also support spatial redundancy by duplicating a single slice
into two or four slices. By convention, the letter
<i>R<sub>s</sub></i> is used to denote the spatial redundancy
(<i>R<sub>s</sub></i> ∈ {1,2,4}) of a given implementation. Within a
machine word, the <i>R<sub>s</sub></i> duplicates of the
i<sup>th</sup> bit are interspersed every 32/<i>R<sub>s</sub></i>
bits, as illustrated by the alternation of colored words
b<sup>j</sup><sub>i∈[1,<i>R<sub>S</sub></i>]</sub> in the figure
above. The following subsections elaborate on doing computations using
this redundant bitslice allocation scheme.


### Higher-order Masked Computation

### Data-redundant Computation

SKIVA uses intra-instruction redundancy (IIR) [37, 38, 39] to protect
implementations against data faults. It supports either a direct
redundant implementation, in which the duplicated slices contain the
same value, or a complementary redundant implementation, in which the
duplicated slices are complemented pairwise. For example, with
<i>R<sub>s</sub></i> = 4, there can be four exact copies (direct
redundancy) or two exact copies and two complementary copies
(complementary redundancy). 

In practice, complementary redundancy is favored over direct
redundancy. First, it is less likely for complemented bits to flip to
consistent values due tosingle fault injection. For instance, timing
faults during state transition [40] or memory accesses [10] follow a
random word corruption or a stuck-at-0 model. Second, complementary
slices ensure a constant Hamming weight for a slic ethroughout the
computation of a cipher. [36] showed that complementary redundancy
results in reduced power leakage when compared to direct redundancy.

### Time-redundant Computation

Data-redundant computation does not protect against control faults
such as in-struction skip. We, therefore, use a different strategy: we
protect our implementation against control faults using temporal
redundancy (TR) across rounds [37]. We pipeline the execution of 2
consecutive rounds in 2 aggregated slices. By convention, we use the
letter <i>R<sub>t</sub></i> to distinguish implementations with
temporal redundancy (<i>R<sub>t</sub></i> = 2) from implementations
without (<i>R<sub>t</sub></i> = 1). For <i>R<sub>t</sub></i> = 2, half
of the slices compute round _i_ while the other half compute round _i_
− 1. The following figure illustrates the principle of time-redundant
bitslicing as applied to AES computation:

<p align="center" style="margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px;">
<img style="height:auto;width:auto;max-width:40%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog/skiva-rt2.png">
</p>

The operation starts the pipeline by filling half of the slices with
the output of the first round of AES, and the other half with the
output of the initial key whitening. At the end of round _i_ + 1, we
have re-computed the output of round _i_ (at a later time): we can,
therefore, compare the two results and detect control faults based on
the different results they may have produced. In contrast to typical
temporal-redundancy countermeasures such as instruction duplication
[40], this technique does not increase code size: the same
instructions compute both rounds at the same time. Only the last AES
round, which is different from regular rounds, must be computed twice
in a non-pipelined fashion.

Whereas pipelining protects the inner round function, faults remain
possible on the control path of the loop itself. We protect against
these threats through standard loop hardening techniques, namely
redundant loop counters – packing multiple copies of a counter in a
single machine word – and duplication of the loop control structure
[41] – producing multiple copies of conditional jumps so as to lower
the odds of all of them being skipped through an injected fault.

## SKIVA implementation

SKIVA relies on custom hardware instructions to efficiently and
securely implement its countermeasures against SCA and fault
attacks. Those new instructions are integrated on the SPARC V8
instruction set of the open-source LEON3 processor. A parched version
of the Leon Bare-C Cross Compilation System's (BCC) assembler allows
to use those instructions either in assembly or in C (using inline
assembly).

### Instructions for bitslicing

To efficiently transpose data into their bitslicied representation,
SKIVA offers the instruction `tr2` (and `invtr2` to perform the
inverse transformation), which interleaves two registers:

<p align="center" style="margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px;">
<img style="height:auto;width:auto;max-width:100%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog/skiva-tr-instr.png">
</p>

Transposing a _n_×_n_ matrix can be done using
<i>n×2<sup>n-1</sup></i> `tr2` instructions. For instance, transposing
a 4×4 matrix can be done with 4 `tr2`:


<p align="center" style="margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px;">
<img style="height:auto;width:auto;max-width:100%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog/skiva-4bit-tr.png">
</p>

By comparison, transposing the same 4×4 matrix without the `tr2`
instruction requires 32 operations (as shown in the [Bitslicing
post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-01-14-bitslicing %})): 8
shifts, 8 `or`s and 16 `and`s.


### Instructions for higher-order masking

Computing a masked multiplication between two shared values `a` and
`b` requires computing their partial share-products. For instance, if
`a` and `b` are represented by two shares
(<code>a<sub>0</sub></code>,<code>a<sub>1</sub></code>) and
(<code>b<sub>0</sub></code>,<code>b<sub>1</sub></code>), then the
partial products
<code>a<sub>0</sub></code>·<code>b<sub>0</sub></code>,
<code>a<sub>0</sub></code>·<code>b<sub>1</sub></code>,
<code>a<sub>1</sub></code>·<code>b<sub>0</sub></code> and
<code>a<sub>1</sub></code>·<code>b<sub>1</sub></code> need to be
computed. Since all the shares of a given value are stored in several
slices of the same register, a single `and` computes _n_ partial
products at once (where _n_ is the number of shares). The shares then
need to be rotated in order to compute the other partial
products. SKIVA offers the `subrot` instruction to perform this
rotation on sub-words. Depending on an immediate parameter, `subrot`
either rotates two-share slices:


<p align="center" style="margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px;">
<img style="height:auto;width:auto;max-width:100%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog/skiva-subrot2.png">
</p>

or four-shares slices:

<p align="center" style="margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px;">
<img style="height:auto;width:auto;max-width:100%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog/skiva-subrot4.png">
</p>


### Instructions for fault redundancy checking and generation

In order to generate redundant bytes to counter fault attacks, SKIVA's
`red` instruction can be used. This instruction can be used to
generate either direct redundancy or complementary redundancy, and
works for both two-shares and four-shares. To generate two-shares
complementary redundant values, the immediate `0b011` would be passed
to `red`:

<p align="center" style="margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px;">
<img style="height:auto;width:auto;max-width:100%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog/skiva-red2.png">
</p>

and `0b101` would be used to generate four-shares complementary
redundant values:

<p align="center" style="margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px;">
<img style="height:auto;width:auto;max-width:100%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog/skiva-red4.png">
</p>

The instruction `ftchk` is used to verify the consistency of redundant
data. In its simplest form, it simply computes the `xnor` (a `xor`
followed by a `not`) of the complementary redundant shares of its
argument. For instance, on a two-shares value:

<p align="center" style="margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px;">
<img style="height:auto;width:auto;max-width:100%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog/skiva-ftchk2.png">
</p>

In that case, if the result is anything by `0`, then both half of the
input are not (complementary) redundant, which means that a fault was
inserted. 

In order to prevent ineffective fault attacks (IFA and SIFA), `ftchk`
can perform majority-voting on four-shares redundant values. If
complementary redundance is used, the behavior of `ftchk` is as
follows:

<p align="center" style="margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px;">
<img style="height:auto;width:auto;max-width:100%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog/skiva-ftchk4.png">
</p>

(where `majority` returns the most common (_i.e._ majoritary) of its
input).


### Instructions for fault-redundant computations

Computations on direct-redundant data can be done using standard
bitwise operations. However, for complementary redundant data, the
bitwise operations have to be adjusted to complement operations. SKIVA
thus offers 6 bitwise instructions to operate of complementary
redundant values. `andc16` (resp. `xorc16` and `xnorc16`) performs
`and` (resp. `xor` and `xnor`) on the lower half of its two-shares
redundant arguments, and a `nand` (resp. `xnor` and `xor`) on the
upper half:

<p align="center" style="margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px;">
<img style="height:auto;width:auto;max-width:100%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog/skiva-andc16.png">
</p>

And `andc8`/`xorc8`/`xnor8` work in the same way on four-shares
redundant values. For instance:

<p align="center" style="margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px;">
<img style="height:auto;width:auto;max-width:100%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog/skiva-andc8.png">
</p>

Those operations can be simply written in C as follows, but would
require 5 instructions rather than one:

```c
#define ANDC8(a,b)   (( ((a) | (b)) & 0xFF00FF00) | ( ((a) & (b)) & 0x00FF00FF))
#define XORC8(a,b)   ((~((a) ^ (b)) & 0xFF00FF00) | ( ((a) ^ (b)) & 0x00FF00FF))
#define ANDC16(a,b)  (( ((a) | (b)) & 0xFFFF0000) | ( ((a) & (b)) & 0x0000FFFF))
#define XORC16(a,b)  ((~((a) ^ (b)) & 0xFFFF0000) | ( ((a) ^ (b)) & 0x0000FFFF))
#define XNORC8(a,b)  (( ((a) ^ (b)) & 0xFF00FF00) | (~((a) ^ (b)) & 0x00FF00FF))
#define XNORC16(a,b) (( ((a) ^ (b)) & 0xFFFF0000) | (~((a) ^ (b)) & 0x0000FFFF))
```

## Results

We used Usubac to generate the 18 different implementations of AES
(all combinations of _D_ ∈ {1,2,4}, <i>R<sub>s</sub></i> ∈ {1,2,4} and
<i>R<sub>t</sub></i> ∈ {1,2}) for SKIVA. We present a performance
evaluation of those 18 implementations, as well as an experimental
validation of the security of our control-flow fault
countermeasures. For an analysis of the power leakage of those
implementations, as well as a theoretical analysis of the security of
SKIVA against data faults, we refer to [36].



### Performance Evaluation

Our experimental evaluation has been carried on a prototype of SKIVA
deployedon the main FPGA (Cyclone IV EP4CE115) of an Altera DE2-115
board. The processor is clocked at 50 MHz and has access to 128 kB of
RAM. Our performance results are obtained by running the desired
programs on bare metal. We assume that we have access to a TRNG that
frequently fills a register with a fresh 32-bit random string. We use
a software pseudo-random number generator (32-bit xorshift) to emulate
a TRNG refreshed at a rate of our choosing.  We checked that our
experiments did not overflow the period of the RNG. Several
implementations of AES are available on our 32-bit, SPARC-derivative
processor, with varying degrees of performance. The constant-time,
byte-sliced implementation (using only 8 variables to represent 128
bits of data) of BearSSL [39] performs at 48 C/B. Our bitsliced
implementation (using 128 variables to represent 128 bits of data)
performs favorably at 44 C/B while weighing 8060B: despite a
significant register pressure (128 live variables for 32 machine
regis-ters), the rotations of MixColumn and the ShiftRows operations
are compiled away. This bitsliced implementation serves as our
baseline in the following.

**Throughput (AES).**

we evaluate the performance of our 18 variants of AES, for each value
of (_D_ ∈ {1,2,4}, <i>R<sub>s</sub></i> ∈ {1,2,4} and
<i>R<sub>t</sub></i> ∈ {1,2}). To remove the influence of the TRNG's
throughput from the performance evaluation, we assume that its refill
frequency is strictly higher than the rate at which our implementation
consumes random bits. In practice, a refill rate of 10 cycles for 32
bits is enough to meet this requirement.

For _D_ and <i>R<sub>t</sub></i> fixed, the throughput decreases
linearly with <i>R<sub>s</sub></i>. At fixed _D_, the variant (_D_,
<i>R<sub>s</sub></i> = 1, <i>R<sub>t</sub></i> = 2) (temporal
redundancy by a factor 2) exhibits similar performances as (_D_,
<i>R<sub>s</sub></i> = 2, <i>R<sub>t</sub></i> = 1) (spatial
redundancy by a factor 2). However, both implementation are not
equivalent from a security standpoint. The former offers weaker
security guarantees than the latter. Similarly, at fixed _ D and
<i>R<sub>s</sub></i>, we may be tempted to run twice the
implementation (_D_, <i>R<sub>s</sub></i>, <i>R<sub>t</sub></i> = 1)
rather than running once the im-plementation (_D_,
<i>R<sub>s</sub></i>, <i>R<sub>t</sub></i> = 2): once again, the
security of the former is reduced compared to the latter since
temporal redundancy (<i>R<sub>t</sub></i> = 2) couples the computation
of 2 rounds within each instruction, whereas pure instruction
redundancy(<i>R<sub>t</sub></i> = 1) does not.


**Code size (AES).**

We measure the impact of our hardware and software design on code
size, using our bitsliced implementation of AES as a baseline. Our
hardware design provides us with native support for spatial,
complementary redundancy (`ANDC`, `XORC`, and `XNORC`). Performing
these operations through software emulation would result in a ×1.3
(for _D_ = 2) to ×1.4 (for _D_ = 4) increase in code size. One must
nonetheless bear in mind that the security provided by emulation is
not equivalent to the one provided by native support. The temporal
redundancy (<i>R<sub>t</sub></i> = 2) mechanism comes at the expense
of a small increase (less than ×1.06) in code size, due to the loop
hardening protections as well as the checks validating results across
successive rounds. The higher-order masking comes at a reasonable
expense in code size: going from 1 to 2 shares increases code size by
×1.5 whereas going from 1 to 4 shares corresponds to a ×1.6
increase. A fully protected implementation (_D_ = 4,
<i>R<sub>s</sub></i> = 4, <i>R<sub>t</sub></i> = 2) thus weighs 13148
bytes.


### Experimental evaluation of temporal redundancy

We simulated the impact of faults on our implementation of AES. We
focus our attention exclusively on control faults (instruction skips)
since we can analytically predict the outcome of data faults [36]. To
this end, we use a fault injection simulator based on gdb running
through the JTAG interface of the FPGA board. We execute our
implementation up to a chosen breakpoint, after which we instruct the
processor to jump to a given address (the address of the after-next
instruction), hence simulating the effect of an instruction skip. In
particular, we have exhaustively targeted every instruction of the
first and last round as well as the `AES_secure` routine (for
<i>R<sub>t</sub></i> = 2) and its counterpart for <i>R<sub>t</sub></i>
= 1. Since rounds 2 to 9 use the same code as the firstround, the
absence of vulnerabilities against instruction skips within the latter
means that the former is secure against instruction skip as well. This
exposes a total of 1248 injection points for <i>R<sub>t</sub></i> = 2
and 1093 injection points for <i>R<sub>t</sub></i> = 1. For each such
injection point, we perform an instruction skip from 512 random
combinations of key and plaintext for <i>R<sub>t</sub></i> = 2 and 352
random combinations for <i>R<sub>t</sub></i> = 1. The results are
summarized in the following table:

Injecting a fault had one of five effects. A fault may yield an
incorrect ciphertext with (1) or without (2) being detected. A fault
may yield a correct ciphertext, with (3) or without (4) being
detected. Finally, a fault may cause the program or the board to crash
(5). According to our attacker model, only outcome (2) witnesses a
vulnerability. In every other outcome, the fault either does not
produce a faulty ciphertext or is detected within two rounds. For
<i>R<sub>t</sub></i> = 2, we verify that every instruction skip was
either detected (outcome 1 or 3) or had no effect on the output of the
corresponding round (outcome 4) or lead to a crash (outcome
5). Comparatively, with <i>R<sub>t</sub></i> = 1, nearly 95% of the
instruction skips lead to an undetected fault impacting
theciphertext. In 0.19% of the cases, the fault actually impacts the
fault-detection mechanism itself, thus triggering a false positive.
