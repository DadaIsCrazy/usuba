**Warning: do not use those programs** (unless you know what you're
doing)

Those programs are starting to be quite old and probably date back
from a time when my benchmarking skills were somewhat lacking. (I'm
not saying that I'm very good at it now; just that I'm less bad than I
used to be :D)

Still, I'll let them here in case I need something from here; who knows.
