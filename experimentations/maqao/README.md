Not much going on here for now.  
We thought that MAQAO (www.maqao.org) could be a good tool to profile
our codes and find out what exactly is going on during the 
execution.  
So far I haven't had a lot of time to invest in that task, so we still
don't know if it will prove useful or not.  
We'll know more soon hopefully.  

The Makefile only generated the files on which the tests can be ran: 
des, des.c, input.txt
