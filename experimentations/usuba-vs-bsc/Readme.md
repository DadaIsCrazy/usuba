Comparison between Usuba and BSC on DES
===

BSC is a prototype bitslicing compiler developped by Thomas Pornin
during his PhD. 

It's not meant to be an optimizing compiler, and the conclusion of
this comparison is thus not "Usuba is better, yay, BSC sucks" but
rather "see, the optimizations done by Usuba are useful!" ;-)

And because I can't say "Usuba's optimizations make Usuba faster than
BSC" without benchmarking it, here we are :D
