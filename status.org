** DONE Convert variables names.
   CLOSED: [2017-02-22 mer. 15:59]
   That's because notations like x.1 generates a variable x1, which can conflict with
   a user-defined variable.
** DONE Allow operators to work on tuples.
   CLOSED: [2017-02-22 mer. 17:41]
   Concrecly, it means allowing to write "a xor b" instead of "a.1 xor b.1; ... ; a.n xor b.n"
** DONE Improve projections.
   CLOSED: [2017-02-23 jeu. 17:50]
   say we have =s1: intn -> int4= and =s2: intn -> int4=
   and =permut: int8 -> intk=
   if we do =permut(s1(...),s2(...))=
   then, the translation to OCaml results in a call looking like =permut(...,...)=,
   ie, =permut: int4 * int4 -> intk=, which is in conflict with =permut: int8 -> intk=
   To solve this, a function =convert: int4 -> int4 -> int8= sould be automatically generated,
   so the OCaml code should look like =permut(convert(s1(...),s2(...))=.
   From this, it will be easy to have n-ary operators.

** DONE Improve the architecture of the compiler
   CLOSED: [2017-03-02 jeu. 14:38]
** DONE Regroup env_var and env_fun into a single env, add helpers to manipulate it
   CLOSED: [2017-03-02 jeu. 14:38]
   Actually, I couldn't regroup them in a single environement, as they don't have the 
   same scope. However, I added some helpers (mainly env_fetch, with returns a "'a option",
   which allows us to use the pattern matching instead of try/catch.
** DONE Add a syntax to loop: either the "fill" operator, or some "for" loop
   CLOSED: [2017-03-03 ven. 18:05]
** DONE Fix bug of nested function calls.
   CLOSED: [2017-03-03 ven. 18:05]
   doing "a = f(b,g(c))" seems to be not working. This needs to be fixed.
** DONE Add arrays of node
   CLOSED: [2017-03-02 jeu. 17:59]
** DONE Add arrays (as a basic type, that will be expanded at compile time)
   CLOSED: [2017-03-03 ven. 14:00]
** DONE Add fill_i operator (and the special nodes going with it)
   CLOSED: [2017-03-03 ven. 18:05]
** DONE Allow fill_i to have an arbitrary expression as initial value
   CLOSED: [2017-03-06 lun. 15:55]
   For now, the initial value of fill_i needs to be variables. This is pretty
   bad; any expression should be fine.
** DONE Add a nicer syntax to describe permutations

** DONE Implement operators on uint_n
   CLOSED: [2017-03-06 lun. 15:41]

   For now, in DES, fill_i needs the key, but in order to do so, we have to

** TODO [#C] Improve pretty printing (with [[http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/first-release-of-pprint/][Ocaml PPrint]] eventually)

* Examples

Note ([2017-02-22 mer.]) : uint_n types have been added, a "vars" section must be 
at the begining of every node, and a few syntaxic modifications have been done over
the past few days. Therefore, some of the following examples might not work on the 
current version. I'll fix that as soon as I can.


** Compilation (parsing, generating OCaml code...)

The program main.native parses a file, creates an AST, print this AST (which looks 
quite like the original program), and generates the OCaml code corresponding to it.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    cd src
    make
    ./main.native tests/simple_node.prog      # just a basic program
    ./main.native tests/simple_when.prog      # a simple when
    ./main.native tests/simple_merge.prog     # a simple merge
    ./main.native tests/s-box-4.prog          # Kwan's 4th s-box
    ./main.native tests/nested_merge.prog     # a nested merge (to make sure the 
                                              # parser works fine on those)
    ./main.native tests/multiple_nodes.prog   # definition of multiple nodes. 
    ./main.native tests/complete_prog_1.prog  # a slightly more complex program
#+END_SRC

** DES

A bitsliced implementation of the first round of DES is in src/tests/des.prog.
Run =./main.native tests/des.prog= to generate the des.ml inside src/tests/ocaml_run .
You can then compile it with =ocamlopt ocaml_runtime.ml des.ml -o des= 
(ocaml_runtime.ml contains a few functions (just one for now) needed to run the
generated programs).


** Equivalence of the lookup based and logical gate based s-box

A standart (ie. with a lookup table) implementation of the 4-th S-box, as well as a
logical one, generated with the command =./main.native tests/s-box-4.prog= are available
in the file =src/tests/verif_sbox.ml= .
It allows you to check that both implementations are equivalent: you just need to run
=ocaml src/tests/verif_sbox.ml=

** Standart DES implementation

A standart implementation of DES is available (file =src/des/des.ml=). This file includes
a few test to verify the correctness of the code. This tests consists in encrypting 2 blocks,
then decrypting them. If the code is correct, this should be equivalent to the identity.
To run those tests:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    cd src/des
    ocamlc -o des des.ml
    ./des
#+END_SRC

You'll see that each test yields the same result, that's a good sign.


* Notes

** A tuple has necessary at least 2 elements. 
First, a tuple of 1 element is just a variable (this element). Secondly, it's easier to parse.

** By convention, the =main= is the last node declared.
(this might change in the future, but it's easier to do this for now)
