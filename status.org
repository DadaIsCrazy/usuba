* Examples

** First example ([2017-02-14 mar.]) : creating an AST, and printing it.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    cd src
    make
    ./main.native tests/simple_node.prog   # just a basic program
    ./main.native tests/simple_when.prog   # a simple when
    ./main.native tests/simple_merge.prog  # a simple merge
    ./main.native tests/s-box-4.prog       # Kwan's 4th s-box
#+END_SRC




* Notes

** A tuple has necessary at least 2 elements. 
First, a tuple of 1 element is just a variable (this element). Secondly, it's easier to parse.
