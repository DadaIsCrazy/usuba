des_kwan.c + test_kwan.c : kwan's code
des_ua_kwan_Std64.C + test_uak_64std_ortho.c : usuba code (with kwan's sboxes,
generated by the Usuba compiler)
des_usuba.c + test_usuba.c : usuba code (with kwan's sboxes), generated by
the usuba compiler, but manually scheduled.


The point of this experimentation was to see if performances could be enhanced by
manually scheduling the C code. 
Conclusion: it works.
